      <h2 id="introduction">Welcome to Fleksy</h2>
      <p>
      Fleksy is a keyboard application that was initially designed for the blind, but is fun to use for everyone.
      Remember, the most important control is <b>flick right for space</b>.
      </p><p>
      For any questions, contact <a href="mailto:support@fleksy.com?Subject=Support%20Request">support@fleksy.com</a>
      </p>
  
      <h2 id="basiccontrols">Basics</h2>
      <p>
      Typing words: Tap away at the keyboard until you have typed all letters of a word. You don't have to hit all the right letters. When done, <b>flick Right</b> to insert a space and autocorrect to the word you intended to type.
      </p><p>
      Alternate Suggestions: Fleksy will get it right most of the time. If it doesn't, simply <b>flick Down</b> to navigate the alternate suggestions shown in the suggestion bar over the keyboard.
      </p><p>
      
      Deleting words: flick Left. Keep in mind, Fleksy deletes whole words and not individual letters.
      </p><p>
      
      Spaces: Fleksy doesn't have a spacebar. A space is added automatically when swiping right to confirm words.
      Built fundamentally to type without looking at the screen, the flick Right gesture is much more reliable and distinct.
      </p><p>
      
      Entering Common Punctuation: While the cursor is resting, flick Right. You have now entered a period. Flick Down to change it to a comma, question mark, and the rest of the symbols shown in the suggestion bar.
      </p><p>
      
      Entering a New Line: Flick Down with Two fingers. Alternatively, tap and hold a finger on the keyboard. More buttons appear around it. Slide your finger the lower right position and the New Line key. Release.
      </p><p>
      
      Entering Numbers: Tap and hold a finger on the keyboard. More buttons appear around it. Slide your finger the lower left position and the Numbers key. Release. To return to Letters, tap the Letters key in the same position.
      </p><p>
      
      Using Text / the Menu Button: To enter the Menu and use your text, tap the Arrow at the top right. Alternatively, tap and hold at the text area.
      </p><p>
      
      <h2 id="advancedcontrols">Advanced Controls</h2>
      <p>
      Entering Advanced Punctuation: Tap and hold on the keys. There is now a new line on top of the keyboard full of symbol groups. Drag your finger over one and release to select it. Navigate with flick Down and Up to other symbols in the same group. Explore.
      </p><p>
      Override Auto Correct: If you choose to, you can undo any correction Fleksy does to your string of characters. After Swiping Right, flick Up.
      </p><p>
      
      Manual Typing mode: For extreme accuracy Tap and hold on the screen and drag to the your first letter. Release. Repeat until your word is formed. In this mode flick Left deletes single characters. When done, flick Right. Your word will not be altered.
      </p><p>
      
      
      <h2 id="dictionary">The Dictionary</h2>
      <p>
      Fleksy comes with a dictionary to help predict your taps. You can add more words and manage them, export and share it, while it syncs automatically with your iCloud.
      </p><p>
      To add words to the Dictionary: Manual Type a word and flick Right. Flick Up to Save. Flick Up again to undo.
      </p><p>
      To delete words from the Dictionary: Manual Type a word you have previously added and flick Right. flick Up to Remove. flick up again to undo.
      </p><p>
      To export and share your Dictionary: Access the menu and choose the Export Dictionary option. Select your recipient and send.
      </p><p>
      To import a Dictionary: If you receive an exported Dictionary from a friend or yourself, you can use the embedded link on the email and your Dictionary will be updated to include all listed words.
